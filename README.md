Layers is a minimalistic wardrobe app that lets you upload clothing items, remove backgrounds, and mix and match pieces to build your ideal wardrobe effortlessly. It's the perfect tool for streamlining your style and planning outfits with ease.

## Why?

### Fashion is one of the most powerful channels for self-expression.
Every person possesses a unique fashion identity, often unbeknownst to them. Recognizing that many, myself included, struggle to express themselves through fashion, three friends and I embarked on creating Layers. This app simplifies the process of curating and executing your ideal wardrobe, making it easier for people to dress well and feel confident.

### Digitizing wardrobes is a game-changer.
By digitizing wardrobes, Layers transforms a traditionally inefficient task (managing and organizing clothes manually) into a streamlined and efficient process. With Layers, users can quickly assess their closet contents, plan outfits, and understand how their wardrobe pieces fit together. Imagine deciding what to wear each morning while still in bed from the tap of a screen.

### Current digital wardrobe apps on the app store are not effective.
We initially tried out some existing digital wardrobe apps on the app store but soon realized that they had messy designs and focused too much on multiple features at once. Practically speaking, they should have first focused on perfecting the wardrobe feature. Instead, these apps spread their efforts too thin and did a mediocre job at everything, rather than excelling in the one important thing: the digital wardrobe. So, we built Layers to be a minimalistic digital wardrobe that gets the one important thing done right: providing a digital wardrobe.

Layers digitizes your clothing items with remarkable ease.

## Design

### Much credit goes to the talented Andrew Chornomorets.
The design shown in the above screenshots was used for our MVP and was heavily inspired by Andrew Chornomorets' <a href='https://www.behance.net/gallery/144250751/Digital-Closet-Mobile-App?tracking_source=search_projects|digital+wardrobe&l=37'>digital wardrobe design project</a>.

### New designs that never reached production.
Here are four screenshots.

</p>
In this design iteration, I focused on:
<ul>
  <li><b>Colors:</b> I muted unnecessary colors to help users focus on the important elements, such as the clothing items and outfits."</li>
  <li><b>Spacing:</b> I minimized unnecessary whitespace and elements to maximize visibility of important content, such as outfit pictures, outfit matching pages, and wardrobe views. Specifically, I removed unnecessary header titles and buttons that obstructed important content.</li>
  <li><b>Expressivity:</b> My initial design lacked expressivity, which is crucial in a digital wardrobe app. Therefore, I focused on enhancing user expressiveness, including features such as adding custom clothing categories, uploading pictures of oneself wearing outfits, close-up shots of clothing items, and tags for individual items.</li>
</ul>
