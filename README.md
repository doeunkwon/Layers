Layers is a minimalistic wardrobe app that lets you upload clothing items, remove backgrounds, and mix and match pieces to build your ideal wardrobe effortlessly. It's the perfect tool for streamlining your style and planning outfits with ease.

## Why?

### Fashion is one of the most powerful channels for self-expression.
Every person possesses a unique fashion identity, often unbeknownst to them. Recognizing that many, myself included, struggle to express themselves through fashion, three friends and I embarked on creating Layers. This app simplifies the process of curating and executing your ideal wardrobe, making it easier for people to dress well and feel confident.

### Digitizing wardrobes is a game-changer.
By digitizing wardrobes, Layers transforms a traditionally inefficient task (managing and organizing clothes manually) into a streamlined and efficient process. With Layers, users can quickly assess their closet contents, plan outfits, and understand how their wardrobe pieces fit together. Imagine deciding what to wear each morning while still in bed from the tap of a screen.

**Layers digitizes your clothing items with remarkable ease.**
