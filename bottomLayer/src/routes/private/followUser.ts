        Follower query user issues:
        1. The follower user can be a non existing user, and return a rowcount of 1
        2. If the user is already a follower of that user, returns rowcount 0
        3. If following user is non existent return rowcount 0

        1. So if double 0, the two users are both following each other already, or both users are non-existent.
        2. If 1,0 one of the users is non-existent, Same with 0,1
        3. If 1,1 successfully followed the user
        The above follows under the assumption that if a user if following another user, he is already in their followers.

        If double 0 and all three queries return errors none of the users exist
        If double 0 and 2 follow queries return errors the two users are following each other already
        If one 0 and 2 queries 1 follow and 1 user the user doesn't exist
        If one 0 and 1 follow query the other user doesn't exist
        I believe these are all the cases
